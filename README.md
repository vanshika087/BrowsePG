# BrowsePG
BrowsePG is a web application designed to simplify the process of finding and listing Paying Guest (PG) accommodations. It provides a seamless platform for tenants to search and book PGs, and for owners to add and manage their listings.

The project is built using the following technologies:
HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the user interface
JavaScript for adding interactivity on the client side
PHP for handling server-side logic and data processing
MySQL as the database for storing user accounts, PG listings, and appointments.

With features like filtered search, detailed listings, and appointment booking, BrowsePG offers a practical solution for PG rentals, combining both functionality and user-friendly design.
